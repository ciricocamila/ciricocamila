I'm a UX/UI Designer.   
I love bean bag chairs, watching the sunset and I'm a cat lover and mother of a kind cat.  


Having fun here and looking for help with JS ES6+, CSS SASS and Frontend React.     
Looking to collaborate on social projects for LGBTQi+ people, black feminism and veganism.  

Nice to meet you!
